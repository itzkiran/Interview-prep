Here is a list of data structures to master:
Arrays and Lists
2D Arrays
Strings
Linked List
Stack
Queue
Hash Table & Hash Set
Heap
Graphs
Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree
Trie
(Month #1) Master a few classic algorithms: You should know how to implement them in < 10 minutes if you practice them a few times.
Binary Search
Breadth First Search
Depth First Search
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Selection Algorithm
(Month #1) Prepare for Recursion and Backtracking: Used very often. Do the following problems to get a good base:
Recursive Practice Problems with Solutions - GeeksforGeeks

Congratulations! You’ve mastered the basics. Now for the good part.
(Month #2 & #3) Get Cracking the Coding Interview(CTCI). It gives you a good baseline. Most questions are on the easier side (for Google and Facebook). But it’s good to know them before proceeding to harder questions.

Note: You don’t need to implement all the questions. Follow this strategy:
For each chapter, implement the first 2 questions. This gives you practice with that data structure.
Then, go down the list of questions and try to solve them. Try visualizing the code in your head. Can you figure out the structure?
If yes, move to the next question to save time.
If no, try implementing the code.

Congratulations! You’re now good at many simple and some advanced problems. Time to do realistic stuff.
(Month #4 and #5) Get Elements of Programming Interviews. This is the best collection of realistic problems for Google/Facebook interviews.
